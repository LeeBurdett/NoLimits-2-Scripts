# NoLimits-2-Scripts
Some scripts for NoLimits 2.

They all have a description and instructions on how to use in them. 
Typically you just set them to your scene objects in the NL2SCO editor
via the "Scripts" tab, and they'll more or less work automatically.

GateScript: Controls the opening and closing of 3D model gates based
on the simulator's information about station gate position. Use it for 
your own 3D model gates so that they open and close like the default
ones.

Hope you find something useful.
